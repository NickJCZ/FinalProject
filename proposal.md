I plan on starting with a general outline of the game and building upon it. I want to plan out all the mini games I want to use and make them before I start the game so I can see where I should put them. I also want to make a fun and entertaining storyline. I definitely need to work a little bit on importing elements into my code in order to make it more unique and fun. I also plan to research game making with python in order to make a complex yet fun game.
